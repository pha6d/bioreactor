/*
 * LEDGrowLight.h
 * This file defines a class for controlling a LED grow light.
 * The class implements the ActuatorInterface and provides methods to turn the LED grow light on or off and control its intensity.
 *
 * Physical modules used:
 * - Relay module connected to the LED grow light
 *
 * The 2835 LED chip emits light in the red and blue spectrum, which are crucial for plant growth. 
 * Red light (around 660 nm) helps in flowering and fruit production, while blue light (around 450 nm) is essential for vegetative growth.
