Installation Instructions:

For the DS18B20 Temperature Sensor:
@https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Waterproof_DS18B20_Digital_Temperature_Sensor__SKU_DFR0198_
1. Connect the DS18B20 to the Arduino using a plugable terminal sensor adapter or directly by wiring.
    - Red Wire (VCC) to 5V or 3.3V on the Arduino.
    - Black Wire (GND) to GND on the Arduino.
    - Blue Wire (Data Signal) to a digital pin on the Arduino (Pin 52 in this case).
2. Use "Gravity: Terminal Sensor Adapter V2.0" @https://www.dfrobot.com/product-203.html
        or Place a 4.7kÎ© pull-up resistor between the VCC and Data Signal lines to ensure proper communication.

For the Gravity: Analog pH Meter V2:
@https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1782.html
1. Connect the pH meter's BNC to the pH probe and the board to the Arduino.
    - Signal Pin to an analog pin on the Arduino (A1 in this case).
    - V+ to 5V on the Arduino.
    - GND to GND on the Arduino.
2. Before taking measurements, calibrate the pH meter with standard buffer solutions.

ATTENTION :
- After completing the measurement, disconnect the pH probe from the signal conversion board. The ph analog sensor probe should not be connected to the signal conversion board without the power supply for a long time
- The bottle cap of the probe contains protective liquid (3.3mol/L KCL). Even if the bottle cap is screwed tightly, some protective liquid may still leak around the bottle cap, forming white crystals. But as long as there is still protective liquid in the bottle cap, it will not affect the life and accuracy of the probe. So please use it with confidence. It is recommended that the white crystals be poured back into the protective liquid in the bottle cap

Installation Instructions:

For the Gravity: Analog pH Meter V2:
@https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Gravity__Analog_pH_Sensor_Meter_Kit_V2_SKU_SEN0161-V2
1. Connect the pH meter's BNC to the pH probe and the board to the Arduino.
    - Signal Pin to an analog pin on the Arduino (A1 in this case).
    - V+ to 5V on the Arduino.
    - GND to GND on the Arduino.
2. Before taking measurements, calibrate the pH meter with standard buffer solutions. @https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Gravity__Analog_pH_Sensor_Meter_Kit_V2_SKU_SEN0161-V2
    -1. Input enterph command in the serial monitor to enter the calibration mode.
    -2. Input calph commands in the serial monitor to start the calibration. The program will automatically identify which of the two standard buffer solutions is present: either 4.0 and 7.0. In this step, the standard buffer solution of 7.0 will be identified.
    -3. After the calibration, input exitph command in the serial monitor to save the relevant parameters and exit the calibration mode. Note: Only after inputing exitph command in the serial monitor can the relevant parameters be saved.
    -4. After the above steps, the first point calibration is completed. The second point calibration will be performed below.
          -Wash the probe with distilled water, then absorb the residual water-drops with paper. Insert the pH probe into the standard buffer solution of 4.0, stir gently, until the values are stable.
          -After the values are stable, the second point can be calibrated. These steps are the same as the first calibration step. The specific steps are as follows:enterph, calph, exitph
    -5. After completing the above steps, the two-point calibration is completed, and then the sensor can be used for actual measurement. The relevant parameters in the calibration process have been saved to the EEPROM of the main control board
ATTENTION : After completing the measurement, disconnect the pH probe from the signal conversion board. The pH probe should not be connected to the signal conversion board without the power supply for a long time.
