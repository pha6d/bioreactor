/*
 * TurbiditySensorSEN0554.h
 * This file defines a class for reading turbidity values from a UART non-contact optical turbidity sensor (SEN0554).
 * The class implements the SensorInterface and provides methods to initialize the sensor and read the turbidity value.
 *
 * Physical modules used:
 * - UART Non-contact Optical Turbidity Sensor SEN0554
 *
 * Installation Instructions:
 * 1. Connect the sensor to the Arduino board:
 *    - Black wire (GND) to GND
 *    - Red wire (VCC) to 5V
 *    - Blue wire (TX) to RX pin (e.g., pin 10 on Arduino)
 *    - Green wire (RX) to TX pin (e.g., pin 11 on Arduino)
 * 2. The two infrared probes should be oppositely installed on a transparent container with a diameter of 40-50mm.
 * 3. Ensure the liquid level is higher than the two probes for accurate measurements.
 *
 * Note: This sensor does not require calibration as it's pre-calibrated. However, ensure to use it within its specified operating temperature range (5-60Â°C).
