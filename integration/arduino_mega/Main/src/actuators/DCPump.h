/*
 * DCPump.h
 * This file defines a class for controlling DC pumps using PWM, a relay, and a motor speed controller.
 * The class implements the ActuatorInterface and provides methods to control the pump with a specified
 * minimum PWM value. This is useful for controlling various types of DC pumps, such as air pumps and liquid drain pumps.
 *
 * Physical modules used:
 * - Relay module
 * - PW1VA01 PWM to Voltage converter
 * - Motor speed controller
 * - DC pump (air pump or liquid drain pump)
